This directory contains misc little utilities I've written or borrowed

Two of note are that I use to install all my other files/directories are:

  - link2home.sh :: Link files and directories and files to $HOME in
                    various  ways.  
  - install :: calls link2home.sh.  

To use install for a directory:

  - Put a COPY (not a link) of /install/ in the directories
  - change the parameters as needed (e.g. --linkdir to link directory
    instead of making a new directory in home, --remove to remove
    files).
  - (optional), add a file named /.link2home.ignore/ to the directory
    listing files to be ignored.  For example:

    #+begin_example
    README.org
    .link2home.ignore
    #+end_example

The basic ideas is that if "install" exists in a directory, you can
just run it and everything will be installed.   The one special case
is this bin directory, which has to be installed first (because all
other installs use link2home.sh)
